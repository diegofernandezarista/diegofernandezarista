## 🧩 Who Am I?
Imagine a **strategist**, a **problem solver**, and a **data geek** all rolled into one. That's me! I thrive on uncovering patterns, automating workflows, and making numbers talk.

🔹 **Data Whisperer:** I turn chaos into dashboards and predictions. Think SQL, Python, Power BI, and Machine Learning models that actually work.

🔹 **Efficiency Fanatic:** Automating tasks is my guilty pleasure. Who needs repetitive manual work when you have Python scripts and SQL queries?

🔹 **Storyteller in Data:** Numbers don’t just exist; they tell stories. I craft those narratives with data visualizations that make sense.
